This repo holds infochimps' house style guides.

We've thought really carefully about these:

* [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/style_guide/ruby-style-guide.md), which is based on https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
* [Chef Style Guide](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan/wiki/style_guide)

Other people have thought pretty carefully about the following:

* [Ruby on Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide)
* [Roodi](https://github.com/martinjandrews/roodi#readme) checks for design issues
* [Reek](https://github.com/kevinrutherford/reek/wiki/code-smells) checks for 'code smells'
* Javascript -- [@unboxed](https://github.com/unboxed/Javascript-Style-Guide)'s and [@chamnap](https://github.com/chamnap/javascript_style_guide)'s look like decent starting points.
