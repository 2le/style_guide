This repo holds infochimps' house style guides.

We've thought really carefully about these:

* [Style Guide for Ruby](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/style_guide/blob/master/style-guide-ruby.md),  which is based on https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
  - [Proposed Addenda](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/style_guide/blob/master/style-guide-ruby-addenda.md),
* [Style Guide for Chef Cookbooks, Recipes, Templates and Clusters](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/ironfan/wiki/style_guide)
* [Style Guide for README files](https://github.com/infochimps-labs/style_guide/blob/master/style-guide-for-readme-files.md)

Other people have thought pretty carefully about the following:

* [Ruby on Rails Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide)
* [Roodi](https://github.com/martinjandrews/roodi#readme) checks for design issues
* [Reek](https://github.com/kevinrutherford/reek/wiki/code-smells) checks for 'code smells'
* Javascript -- [@unboxed](https://github.com/unboxed/Javascript-Style-Guide)'s and [@chamnap](https://github.com/chamnap/javascript_style_guide)'s look like decent starting points.
